# Simple Versioner
A basic script to allow simple versioning of a folder in windows

## Usage
You should modify the two global variables _cheminFichierASauvegarder_ and _cheminSauvegarde_.

* __cheminFichierASauvegarder__ : The path to the folder which should be saved.
* __cheminSauvegarde__ : The path to the folder where it should be saved.

## Why
At the early stage of Minecraft, the game was not known to randomly cause corruption of saves files.
Sometimes you could loose hundred of hours because of theses bugs.

I created that script to make some backup in another folder sometimes. It allowed me to keep my working saves and avoid loosing entire games.
I allowed to try updating to a newer version of Minecraft (even during snapshot time) and don't put my save file at risk.

I figured it could be used in other way even it is just a simple full copy versioner.
